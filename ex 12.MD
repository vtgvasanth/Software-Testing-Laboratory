### DATE: 22/10/2024                                                                          
### REGISTER NUMBER :  212222040175
### AIM: 
To write a python program for addition of two numbers and test the test cases using Pytest.

### Algorithm:
1. Write the python program for addition of two numbers
2. Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested
should have assert keyword at the beginning
3. Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_add.py”.
4. Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program
is saved and type “pytest test_add.py” and run it.

### Program:
```
def add(a,b):
return a+b
def test_3_plus_5_equals_8():
assert add(3,5) == 8
def test_2_plus_3_equals_5():
assert add(2,3) == 6
```

### Output:
![STLN](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c459758c-e8a3-4f6a-87a9-2e9bcc983b88)

### Result:
Thus, the python program for addition is tested using pytest and executed and output is verified successfully
